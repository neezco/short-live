# Neezco Cache 🚀

**A smart, lightweight caching library that helps you store data temporarily with automatic cleanup.**

## Why Neezco Cache?

### 🏷️ **Tag-Based Invalidation**

Group related data and clear it all with a single command.

### 🎯 **Smart Memory Management**

Intelligently prioritizes what to clean up based on usage patterns and memory constraints.

### ⚡ **CPU Efficient**
